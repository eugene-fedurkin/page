          <h5>
            Arkanoid is a video game for gaming machines, developed by Taito in 1986. The game is based on Atari games. It was her name that became a household name for a class of similar games.<br />
             The player controls a small racket platform that can be moved horizontally from one wall to the other, exposing it to the ball, preventing it from falling down. The player has three lives. The impact of the ball on the brick leads to the destruction of the brick. In turn, the gray brick, for destruction, requires the ball to hit two times.

              Classic game Arkanoid has a rich and long history. Since the days of the first version, which aroused the interest of developers to this genre, it took several decades. During this time, many game consoles, computers and, most importantly, a whole generation of people have changed, but this does not stop Arkanoid from remaining a very popular game today, and all because the classic is immortal.
      The history of this genre takes its origins back in 1958, when physicist William Higinbotham assembled from various radio components a device that allowed playing primitive tennis on the oscilloscope screen. The game was made for two, and the control was carried out using a special controller. The physicist, not comprehending the value of his invention, did not patented the game and disassembled it after a while. Then in 1972 the company Meganvox released the prefix Odyssey 1TL200. Using the console and TV it was possible to play in a slightly more advanced tennis with more convenient joysticks. A little later, well-known to this day, Atari company released the game Pong, which blew up the video game market and became very popular. A few years after this, Atari needed another "bomb", which would be sold in millions of copies. Who do you think they turned to for this novelty? It was our favorite modern hero Steve Jobs, who at that time worked in Atari. They turned to Jobs, but the development was led by his friend Steve Wozniak, who in turn worked for HP at the time.
